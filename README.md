A right angle triangle has three sides denoted the hypotenuse for the longest side (the side opposite the right angle) and two others known as the adjacent or opposite depending on their relationship to the angles. For example, for the angle **Î²**, **b** would be opposite and **a** would be adjacent.  For the other angle the roles of a and b would be reversed.

The formula are:
